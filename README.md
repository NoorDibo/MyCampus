Web Slider Implementation

For the image slider feature on our website, we utilized a pre-existing template as a base for our implementation. This template, "Slider and Slider CSS Nav Icon Layout," was originally designed by Hunter Garrett and is available on CodePen at the following URL: https://codepen.io/hunterbecton/pen/jOzVLGR.

Our adaptation involved modifying the image sources to align with our content and adjusting the CSS to match our site's design language. The original code provided a robust starting point, and with our modifications, it integrated seamlessly into the website. following block represents the adapted code which was included in our project:

<!-- Slider and Slider CSS Nav Icon Layout adapted from CodePen by Hunter Garrett -->
<!-- Source: https://codepen.io/hunterbecton/pen/jOzVLGR -->
<div class="slider-wrapper">
  <!-- Customized images for the slider -->
  <div class="slider">
    <img id="slide-1" src="/img/campus1.jpg" alt="Campus Image 1"/>
    <img id="slide-2" src="/img/campus2.jpg" alt="Campus Image 2"/>
    <img id="slide-3" src="/img/campus3.jpg" alt="Campus Image 3"/>
  </div>
  <!-- Navigation for the slider -->
  <div class="slider-nav">
    <a href="#slide-1">Slide 1</a>
    <a href="#slide-2">Slide 2</a>
    <a href="#slide-3">Slide 3</a>
  </div>
</div>

Our modifications ensured that the slider fits the visual and functional requirements of our website, providing users with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing way to navigate through a series of images.
